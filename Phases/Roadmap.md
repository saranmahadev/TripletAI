  - Powered by different AI models (Selected by user) with an API fallback option for flexibility.
- **Basic Chat Interface**
  - A Webview panel in VS Code for natural language queries (e.g., "Explain this code").
  - Automatically includes the active file or selected code as context for relevant responses.
  - Features a simple UI with a text input field and output display.
- **Local AI Integration**
  - Integrates Ollama to run a lightweight AI model locally on the user’s machine.
  - Includes settings to toggle between local and cloud-based API models.

- **Configuration**
  - Offers VS Code settings to customize model selection and suggestion length.
  - Supports a basic project-level configuration file (`.tripletAI.json`) for tailored behavior.
- **Language Support**
  - Uses Tree-sitter for syntax parsing of JS, Python, and TS files.
  - Automatically detects file types to provide context-aware suggestions.

**Key Considerations:**
- Prioritize stability and ease of use to ensure a positive first impression.
- Simplify local AI setup with clear installation instructions and troubleshooting guides.

### Phase 3: Standout Capabilities

**Timeline:** July 6 - October 6, 2025 (3 months)  
**Goal:** Introduce unique, standout features that set **TripletAI** apart from other AI coding tools, emphasizing customization and an exceptional user experience.  
**Features:**

- **Dynamic Context Window**
  - Intelligently adjusts the context size based on file complexity and structure.
  - Prioritizes the most relevant code sections for accurate suggestions.
- **Multi-Model Support**
  - Allows switching between multiple local AI models (e.g., Llama, Grok) within the extension.
  - Offers community-shared presets tailored to specific programming tasks.
- **Code Style Adaptation**
  - Learns the user’s naming conventions and coding style over time.
  - Adapts suggestions to match project-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- **Interactive Diff Previews**
  - Displays editable diff previews for AI-generated suggestions before applying changes.
  - Maintains an undo stack for reversing AI modifications.
- **Voice Commands**
  - Enables voice input for chat queries (e.g., "Write a loop") using a configurable activation phrase.
  - Ensures privacy by making voice features optional and locally processed.
- **Live Code Insights**
  - Provides real-time complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity) on hover.
  - Warns about potential issues like infinite loops or performance bottlenecks.

**Key Considerations:**
- Implement lightweight machine learning for style adaptation without heavy dependencies.
- Ensure voice command functionality respects user privacy and is toggleable.
- Test across diverse codebases to fine-tune dynamic context and insights.

**Deliverable:** **TripletAI v0.3** will be released by October 6, 2025, showcasing unique capabilities that elevate the tool’s value.
